## Milestone 1: Mockup Development

Work for Milestone 1 began on April 6, 2017 and ended on April 13, 2017.

The goal was to create mockup pages for the system. The pages were created as a Meteor app to simplify the development process.

Progress of Milestone one was managed by [MonoaCoderCentral GitHub Project M1](https://github.com/manoacodercentral/monoacodercentral/projects/1).

Each issues was implemented in its own and merged into master upon completion. Occasionally one or two line changes were implemented directly in master when not part of an issue.

## Milestone 1: Mockup Development

Work for Milestone 1 began on April 6, 2017 and ended on April 13, 2017.

The goal was to create mockup pages for the system. The pages were created as a Meteor app to simplify the development process.

Mockups for the following pages were completed during Milestone 1.

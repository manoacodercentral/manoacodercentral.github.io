## Milestone 1: Mockup Development

Work for Milestone 1 began on April 6, 2017 and ended on April 13, 2017.

The goal was to create mockup pages for the system. The pages were created as a Meteor app to simplify the development process.

Mockups for the following pages were completed during Milestone 1.

Each issues was implemented in its own branch and merged into master upon completion. Occasionally one or two line changes were implemented directly in master when not part of an issue.

## Milestone 2: Information plumbing

This milestone started on April 14, 2017 and ended on April 27, 2017.

Basically, we talked and decided what information will be recorded how it will be displayed. We created collections the will hold information about profiles, project requests, and a couple global collections (os listings, programming languages listings)

Milestone 2 was implemented as [ManoaCoderCentral GitHub Milestone 2](https://github.com/manoacodercentral/manoacodercentral/projects/2)::

Milestone 2 finished seven issues, and progress was recorded via the [ManoaCoderCentral GitHub Project M2](https://github.com/manoacodercentral/manoacodercentral/projects/2):
